## My process

I Tried vanilla CSS first but after a while number of class names got out of control so I thought maybe this project should be done using Tailwind CSS. Turned out this was a great decision... Thanks Tailwind :)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- div-less structure (no extra useless div tags)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Main framework for CSS styling
- Mobile-first workflow
